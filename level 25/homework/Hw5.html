    <h1>The best club in England</h1>
    <h2>Liverpool</h2>
       <p>was founded in 1892 following a dispute between Everton F.C. <p>
       <p> and John Houlding, the owner of Anfield. After Everton left Anfield,</p>
       <p> Houlding established a new club to occupy the stadium. Initially named </p>
       <p> "Everton Athletic," the club was renamed Liverpool F.C. due to naming conflicts with the </p>
       <p>existing Everton club. Their first match was a friendly against Rotherham Town on September 1, 1892, which they won 7–1.</p>
    <h2>Rise to Prominence (1960s–1980s)</h2>
      <p>The club's golden era began in the 1960s under manager Bill Shankly,
      <p> who transformed Liverpool into a dominant force in English football. </p>
      <p>Shankly led the team to three league titles and a UEFA Cup victory. </p>
      <p>His successor, Bob Paisley, continued this success,</p>
      <p>securing six league titles and three European Cups (1977, 1978, and 1981).  </p>
      <p> Paisley's tenure solidified Liverpool's reputation as a powerhouse in European football.</p>
    <h2>Modern Success and Challenges (2000s-2025s)</h2>
    <p>The 2000s saw Liverpool achieve notable successes, including winning the UEFA Champions League in 2005, 
      <p>  famously overturning a 3–0 deficit to win against AC Milan. Under manager Jürgen Klopp,</p>
      <p> Liverpool secured their sixth European Cup in 2019 and ended a 30-year wait for a league title by winning the </p>
      <p>  Premier League in 2020. In the 2024–25 season, Liverpool won their 20th league title, </p>
      <p>  equaling Manchester United's record.The 2000s saw Liverpool achieve notable successes, </p>
